  title: Dream It. Do It. Alabama
  text: "<p>On my Dream It. Do It. Alabama website, I take immense pride in showcasing my contributions to the manufacturing industry, specifically my significant role in the Alabama Automotive Manufacturers Association (AAMA) scholarship program. Over the past five years, I have been instrumental in creating and continually reinventing the scholarship process, ensuring its adaptability to evolving educational needs and industry requirements. My dedication to this program led to me being honored with the AAMA Impact Award, recognizing my unwavering commitment to education and my pivotal role in developing the next generation of manufacturing professionals. This award underscores the effectiveness of the scholarship program and my dedication to closing the skills gap in this thriving sector.</p>
  <p>Manufacturing offers competitive salaries, with the average U.S. manufacturing worker earning $81,289 annually, according to NAM. In Alabama, industrial manufacturing and transportation account for 22% of the workforce, making a significant impact. Furthermore, manufacturing jobs contribute 11% to Alabama's GDP, emphasizing its vital role in the state's economy. It is noteworthy that 52% of U.S. employers are grappling with challenges in filling manufacturing positions, signifying the ever-increasing demand for a skilled workforce.</p>
  <p>To empower individuals in discovering their ideal manufacturing careers, I provide a personalized assessment, assisting them in identifying areas of interest within the manufacturing landscape. Additionally, I have been actively involved in selecting the individuals who receive these scholarships, ensuring that they are awarded to those most deserving and passionate about pursuing a career in manufacturing. This hands-on involvement not only nurtures the growth of the industry but also creates a pathway for students to achieve prosperous careers.</p>
  <p>My journey in manufacturing, coupled with the AAMA Impact Award, reflects my commitment to the industry's growth and the success of individuals I've been privileged to support and mentor.</p>"
