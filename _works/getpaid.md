  title: Get Paid
  text: "<p>The Get Paid page I created for the Alabama Community College System serves as a doorway to apprenticeship programs in manufacturing, offering paid learning opportunities to a diverse audience, including individuals with disabilities, women, minorities, veterans, and those with prior incarceration experience. By blending classroom education with practical training at leading manufacturing companies, apprentices gain valuable skills with potential tuition coverage by their employers. This page reimagines traditional apprenticeships in modern, thriving industries, highlighting their job security, debt-free education, and broad accessibility to individuals seeking career development. It inspires visitors to explore these transformative opportunities for a promising future.</p>"
