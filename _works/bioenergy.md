  text: "<p>I'm excited to present the website I created for the Wood Bioenergy Conference & Expo, an event hosted by Hatton-Brown Publishers. This project epitomizes my commitment to innovative web design. I designed a custom WordPress theme from scratch, utilizing the power of PHP, HTML, CSS/SASS, and JavaScript to ensure a seamless and visually appealing digital presence. Notably, I implemented a custom post type for the sponsors page, granting visitors the convenience of alphabetically sorting through the diverse list of sponsors.</p>"
