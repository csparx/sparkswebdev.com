  title: ACCS Online
  text: "<p>I had the opportunity to design and build the community website for the Alabama Community College System. One of the key features of this website was to promote community involvement with the 24 community colleges under the ACCS umbrella. The goal was to emphasize the importance of these colleges as active contributors to their local communities. The resulting web copy reflects this commitment: 'At Alabama's 24 community colleges, community involvement is at the heart of our mission. We are dedicated to fostering strong and enduring connections with our local communities, not only through on-campus events but also through meaningful collaborations beyond our campuses. We take immense pride in our unwavering commitment to making a positive impact in numerous ways. Whether it's through educational initiatives, workforce development programs, or a wide range of community engagement projects, we're here to enrich the lives of those we serve and contribute to the growth and well-being of our beloved Alabama communities. Join us in this shared journey of learning, development, and progress as we continue to build a brighter future together.' I also added a practical feature, enabling college staff to submit their events for display on the website. This function gathered all the submitted events from our 24 colleges, making it easier for the community to stay updated and involved. This project not only showcased my web development skills but also allowed me to contribute to a valuable community-oriented initiative.</p>"
