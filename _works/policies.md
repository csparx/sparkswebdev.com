  title: PDF Search Custom Plugin
  text: "<p>I created a custom Wordpress plugin to allow visitors on the Alabama Community College website to be able to search through our library of PDF policies and procedures. The plugin converts the PDFs to text based on the category selected and names the file based on the id of the PDF in the media library when uploaded. The search function combs through the text documents and outputs the list of policies and procedures that match the term searched.</p>"
