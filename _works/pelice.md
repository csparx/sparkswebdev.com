  title: Panel & Engineered Lumber International Conference & Expo Website
  text: "<p>Featured in my portfolio is the website I thoughtfully created for Hatton-Brown Publishers' esteemed event, the Panel & Engineered Lumber International Conference & Expo. This project truly reflects my passion for creating tailored digital experiences. I developed a custom WordPress theme, harnessing the power of PHP, HTML, CSS/SASS, and Javascript to ensure a seamless, visually engaging platform. Notably, I implemented a custom post type for the sponsors page, providing visitors with a convenient and intuitive alphabetical sorting feature.</p>"
