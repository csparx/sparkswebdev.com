  title: ACCS Homepage Update
  text: "<p>I led a comprehensive revamp of the Alabama Community College System homepage, transforming it into a dynamic and user-centric digital hub. The redesign featured a modern, visually appealing layout with intuitive navigation, ensuring that students, faculty, and stakeholders could easily access essential information. We prioritized user experience, implementing responsive design elements for seamless browsing across devices. I integrated cutting-edge technology to enhance functionality, such as a robust search engine and interactive maps to locate campuses. The content was reorganized to provide quick access to admissions, programs, and support services, fostering engagement and simplifying the application process. Through this revamp, we successfully elevated the online presence of the Alabama Community College System, making it a more informative, engaging, and accessible platform for all users.</p>"
