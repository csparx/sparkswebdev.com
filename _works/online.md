  title: ACCS Online
  text: "<p>I developed the ACCS Online page with the primary goal of streamlining the process for students to discover if specific programs were available online across our affiliated colleges. To achieve this, I implemented an innovative shortcode system that dynamically pulls data from our database, matching the chosen program with the appropriate colleges that offer it online. This solution not only enhances user convenience but also provides up-to-date and accurate information, ensuring students can make informed decisions about their educational pathways. The ACCS Online page represents a powerful tool in our commitment to expanding online education accessibility and supporting students in their academic pursuits.</p>"
